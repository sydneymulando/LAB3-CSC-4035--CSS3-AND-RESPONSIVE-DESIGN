              A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE KEY FEATURES USED IN THE PROJECT

##Selectors

#Universal Selector (*): Resets box-sizing, margin, and padding for all elements to ensure consistent layout calculations.

#Element Selectors: Styles basic HTML elements like body, h1, h2, h3, p, a, main, header, and footer for consistent typography and structure.

#Class Selectors: Targets specific components like .navbar, .nav-links, .hero, .service-card, .contact-form, etc., for page-specific styling.

#Pseudo-Class Selectors: Uses :hover (e.g., a:hover, .service-card:hover) and :focus (e.g., .form-group input:focus) for interactive states, and .active for navigation highlighting.

#Attribute Selectors: Styles input[type="text"], input[type="email"] for form fields with specific types.

#Child and Descendant Selectors:
     # Examples like .form-group label and .service-card h2 target nested elements for precise control.


Media Queries (Responsive Design)

3 Breakpoints (as required):

#max-width: 1024px: Adjusts font sizes, hero heading, service grid column width, and flex container spacing for large tablets/small laptops.

#max-width: 768px: Switches navbar to a column layout, stacks home page flex content vertically, reduces service grid column size, and tweaks padding/margins for tablets.

#max-width: 480px: Further simplifies layout for mobile phones with a single-column service grid, centered navbar links stacked vertically, and reduced padding/font sizes.
Purpose: Ensures the site adapts smoothly across devices, enhancing usability and readability.


Flexbox and Grid

Flexbox:

#Navigation (.navbar): Uses display: flex with justify-content: space-between to align the logo and nav links horizontally (switches to column on smaller screens).
Nav Links (.nav-links): display: flex arranges links side-by-side, stacking vertically on mobile.
Home Content (.home-content-wrapper): display: flex creates a side-by-side layout for intro and sidebar, with flex: 3 and flex: 1 for proportional sizing (stacks on tablets).
Body Layout: body uses display: flex with flex-direction: column and min-height: 100vh to push the footer to the bottom, with main using flex-grow: 1.


Grid:

Services (.services-grid): display: grid with grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)) creates a responsive grid of service cards that adjusts column count based on screen width (down to 1fr on mobile).
##Animation Features


Transitions:

Applied to links (a), buttons (.cta-button, .submit-button), form fields (.form-group input), and service cards (.service-card) using transition for smooth changes in properties like color, background-color, border-color, transform, and box-shadow over --transition-speed (0.3s).
Examples: Hover effects on links/buttons, focus effects on form fields, and card elevation on hover.


Keyframes:
@keyframes fadeIn: Animates opacity from 0 to 1, used on the .hero section for a fade-in effect over 1.5s.
@keyframes slideInDown: Animates h1 elements from a 30px upward offset with opacity 0 to their final position with opacity 1 over 0.8s, adding a subtle entrance effect.
